# @segment/analytics-react-native-plugin-onetrust

Plugin for adding support for [OneTrust](https://onetrust.com/) CMP to your React Native application.

⚠️ version 1.2.0 and below are out of date and upgrading will require a re-implementation of the plugin configuration. 

⚠️ The SDK version used must match the version of the JSON published from your OneTrust instance. This Provider was built using `202405.1.0`. This is not a "plugin" as defined by the SDK's [plugin-timeline architecture](https://github.com/segmentio/analytics-react-native/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#plugins--timeline-architecture). Instead, it must be used with the `ConsentPlugin` included in the core SDK. This is deliberate as it is impossible to support every possible version of the OneTrust SDK. Therefore, the `OneTrustConsentProvider` should serve as a reference/example for users on a different version. 

## Installation

You will need to install the `@segment/analytics-react-native-plugin-onetrust` package as a dependency in your project:

Using NPM:

```bash
npm install --save @segment/analytics-react-native-plugin-onetrust react-native-onetrust-cmp
```

Using Yarn:

```bash
yarn add @segment/analytics-react-native-plugin-onetrust react-native-onetrust-cmp
```

## Usage

Follow the [instructions for adding plugins](https://github.com/segmentio/analytics-react-native#adding-plugins) on the main Analytics client:

After you create your segment client there are a few steps you must follow to complete your One Trust integration.

1. Initialize the `OneTrust` SDK:

```ts
import OTPublishersNativeSDK from 'react-native-onetrust-cmp';

...

OTPublishersNativeSDK.startSDK(
  'storageLocation',
  'domainIdentifier',
  'languageCode',
  {countryCode: 'us', regionCode:'ca'},
  true,
)
  .then((responseObject) => {
    console.info('Download status is ' + responseObject.status);
    // get full JSON object from responseObject.responseString
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(`OneTrust download failed with error ${error}`);
  });
```

2. Create a new `OneTrustConsentProvider` and pass the `OneTrust` SDK to it: 

```ts
import { createClient, ConsentPlugin } from '@segment/analytics-react-native';
import OTPublishersNativeSDK from 'react-native-onetrust-cmp';
import { OTCategoryConsentProvider } from '@segment/analytics-react-native-plugin-onetrust'

...

 const oneTrustProvider = new OneTrustConsentProvider(OTPublishersNativeSDK)
```

3. Initialize a new `ConsentPlugin` and pass the `OneTrustConsentProvider` to it: 

```ts
import OTPublishersNativeSDK from 'react-native-onetrust-cmp';
import { OneTrustConsentProvider  } from '@segment/analytics-react-native-plugin-onetrust'

...

const oneTrustProvider = new OneTrustConsentProvider(OTPublisherNativeSDK)
const oneTrustPlugin = new ConsentPlugin(oneTrustProvider);
```

4. Add `oneTrustPlugin` as a plugin, order doesn't matter, this plugin will apply to all device mode destinations you add before and after this plugin is added. 

5. Call `oneTrustPlugin.start()` to start event flow.

 Full example below:

```ts
import { createClient, ConsentPlugin} from '@segment/analytics-react-native';
import { OneTrustConsentProvider } from '@segment/analytics-react-native-plugin-onetrust';
import OTPublishersNativeSDK from 'react-native-onetrust-cmp';

OTPublishersNativeSDK.startSDK(
  'storageLocation',
  'domainIdentifier',
  'languageCode',
  {countryCode: 'us', regionCode:'ca'},
  true,
)
  .then((responseObject) => {
    console.info('Download status is ' + responseObject.status);
    // get full JSON object from responseObject.responseString
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(`OneTrust download failed with error ${error}`);
  });

const segment = createClient({
  writeKey: 'SEGMENT_KEY',
});


const oneTrustProvider = new OneTrustConsentProvider(OTPublisherNativeSDK)
const oneTrustPlugin = new ConsentPlugin(oneTrustProvider);

segment.add({ plugin: oneTrustPlugin });

// NOTE: You might want to wait until CMP is ready before you call start()
// so that events are held until the CMP is ready to provide the current consent status.
onetrustPlugin.start()


// device mode destinations
segment.add({ plugin: new BrazePlugin() });
```
