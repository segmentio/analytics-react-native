# @segment/analytics-react-native-plugin-facebook-app-events

`DestinationPlugin` for [Facebook App Events](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/app-events/). Wraps [`react-native-fbsdk-next`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-fbsdk-next).

## Installation

You need to install the `@segment/analytics-react-native-plugin-facebook-app-events` and the `react-native-fbsdk-next` dependency.

Using NPM:
```bash
npm install --save @segment/analytics-react-native-plugin-facebook-app-events react-native-fbsdk-next
```

Using Yarn:
```bash
yarn add @segment/analytics-react-native-plugin-facebook-app-events react-native-fbsdk-next
```

Run `pod install` after the installation to autolink the Facebook SDK.

Follow the instructions in [Configure projects](https://github.com/thebergamo/react-native-fbsdk-next#3-configure-projects) of React-Native-fbsdk-next to finish the setup of FBSDK.

See [React Native FBSDK Next](https://github.com/thebergamo/react-native-fbsdk-next) for more details of this dependency. The plugin automatically calls the `Settings.initializeSDK();` method, so you do not need to explictly add that code to your app. Adding the method again may result in an error.
## Usage

Follow the [instructions for adding plugins](https://github.com/segmentio/analytics-react-native#adding-plugins) on the main Analytics client:

In your code where you initialize the analytics client call the `.add(plugin)` method with an `FacebookAppEventsPlugin` instance:

```ts
import { createClient } from '@segment/analytics-react-native';

import { FacebookAppEventsPlugin } from '@segment/analytics-react-native-plugin-facebook-app-events';

const segmentClient = createClient({
  writeKey: 'SEGMENT_KEY'
});

segmentClient.add({ plugin: new FacebookAppEventsPlugin() });
```
